I'm a Frontend Developer who enjoy learning more about open-source. I like to design and build up minimalistic designs. Some technologies I enjoy working with are: ReactJS, VanillaJS, SASS, Bulma.io and recently, TailwindCSS and so React-Native and GraphQL. I am very passionate and I really enjoy learning.
